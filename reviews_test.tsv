This product exceeded my expectations and the build quality is outstanding.
The item arrived broken and customer service never responded to my emails.
It's okay overall, but there are better alternatives for the price.
Absolutely love it! I would recommend this to everyone.
The instructions were confusing and the accessories were missing.
Solid value for the money and works exactly as described.
Mediocre performance and the battery drains too quickly.
Fantastic experience from ordering to delivery.
Disappointed because it stopped working after just one week.
